      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/879582744">Link to The LeBron James Shooting Challenge Game</a></p>
      <p>Have you ever considered playing a Top 2 Greatest Basketball Player of all time in a game of 1 on 1 basketball?
        In this game, Fortnite Exclusive Skin and 4x NBA Champion, LeBron James, challenges you to a shooting challenge.
        This was one of my first ever coded creations, and probably my most favorite one to this day. I faced numerous
        challenges throughout the process of making this, and took me roughly 9 hours to complete. </p>

      <p>In this project, you can pick what shape you want to have based off of the selections given on the screen. My partner and I struggled to find the solution to allowing the player to choose how many sides they want on their shape. </p>

      <h2>Favorite Project</h2>
      <p>
      Description: I hold an everlasting admiration for LEGOs. Over the summer, my significant other gave me a flower LEGO set and out of all the LEGO sets that I have built throughout my life, this is by far my most favorite one that I have built. The flowers in the pot were fragile and unbalanced at times, so a couple of times, the flowers would fall and break apart.</p>

      Description: For my Fall Genius Hour Project, I decided to create a drawing of one of my favorite Pok√©mon, Snorlax. I partook in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Academy. Through these online lessons, I learned how to utilize shapes to create fun, creative images, allowing me to expand my creative imagination through Python.</p>

      Description: For my AP Create Final Project, I decided to create a shopping simulator game, "Let's Go Shopping!". This game allows for the user to add shopping items to their shopping list, and search throughout the grocery store for these desired items! This game required a lot of time and energy to create. I hope you enjoy!</p>

      Description: In this in-class project, my partner and I created a stoplight through the use of Pi Pico with MicroPython. This project was a struggle to make because my partner and I were introduced to many new pieces of technology and there was plenty of trial and error. Overall, it was a fun project to make.</p>
