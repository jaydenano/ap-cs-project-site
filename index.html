      <p>Have you ever considered playing a Top 2 Greatest Basketball Player of all time in a game of 1 on 1 basketball?
        In this game, Fortnite Exclusive Skin and 4x NBA Champion, LeBron James, challenges you to a shooting challenge.
        This was one of my first ever coded creations, and probably my most favorite one to this day. I faced numerous
        challenges throughout the process of making this, and took me roughly 9 hours to complete. </p>

      <p>In this project, you can pick what shape you want to have based off of the selections given on the screen. My partner and I struggled to find the solution to allowing the player to choose how many sides they want on their shape. </p>

      Description: I hold an everlasting admiration for LEGOs. Over the summer, my significant other gave me a flower LEGO set and out of all the LEGO sets that I have built throughout my life, this is by far my most favorite one that I have built. The flowers in the pot were fragile and unbalanced at times, so a couple of times, the flowers would fall and break apart.</p>
